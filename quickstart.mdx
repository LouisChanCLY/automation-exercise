## Complete Beginner Path {#complete-beginner}

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand the Basics">
    **What is automation?**
    - Automation means teaching computers to do repetitive tasks for you
    - No coding required - we use visual tools
    - Think of it like creating a recipe that a computer follows

    **What is AI?**
    - AI understands and processes information like humans do
    - We'll use it to read emails, understand text, and make decisions
    - You don't need to understand how it works, just how to use it
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Your Accounts">
    You'll need three free accounts. We'll guide you through each:

    1. **Gmail** - You probably have this already
    2. **n8n** - Our automation platform (like Lego for workflows)
    3. **OpenRouter** - Provides AI capabilities

    <Note>
      All accounts are free. No credit card required.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your First Exercise">
    Begin with Email Classification - our most beginner-friendly exercise:
