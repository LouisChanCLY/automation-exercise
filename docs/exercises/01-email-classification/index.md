# Exercise 1: Email Classification

## What You'll Build

In this hands-on exercise, you'll create a **smart email classification system** that automatically processes
incoming emails, understands their content using AI, and takes intelligent actions based on the message context.
By the end of this 45-minute session, you'll have a working automation that can:

- Monitor your Gmail inbox in real-time
- Use AI to understand email priority, sentiment, and intent
- Automatically organise emails with smart labels
- Track all classifications for performance insights
- Route urgent matters for immediate attention

## Why This Exercise Matters

### The Problem We're Solving

The average knowledge worker spends **28% of their workweek** managing email (McKinsey Global Institute).
For a team of 10 people, that's equivalent to having 3 full-time employees just reading and sorting emails.
This exercise teaches you to reclaim that time through intelligent automation.

### Real-World Applications

| Department | Key Benefits | Time Saved | ROI |
|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------|:----|
| **Customer Support** | ‚Ä¢ Reduce response time to minutes<br>‚Ä¢ Auto-escalate angry customers<br>‚Ä¢ Create tickets automatically<br>‚Ä¢ Track sentiment trends | 3-4 hours/day | 300% |
| **Sales Teams** | ‚Ä¢ Never miss hot leads<br>‚Ä¢ Smart enquiry routing<br>‚Ä¢ Automated follow-ups<br>‚Ä¢ Priority opportunity ranking | 2-3 hours/day | 250% |
| **HR Departments** | ‚Ä¢ Categorise by urgency<br>‚Ä¢ Route sensitive matters<br>‚Ä¢ Track common questions<br>‚Ä¢ Ensure compliance | 2 hours/day | 200% |
| **Personal Use** | ‚Ä¢ AI-powered inbox sorting<br>‚Ä¢ Deadline detection<br>‚Ä¢ Automated acknowledgements<br>‚Ä¢ Searchable email database | 1-2 hours/day | Priceless |

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this exercise, you will:

1. **Master API Integration** - Connect multiple cloud services using OAuth2 authentication
2. **Understand AI Prompting** - Write effective prompts that get consistent results from LLMs
3. **Build Conditional Logic** - Create intelligent routing based on AI classifications
4. **Implement Error Handling** - Ensure your automation runs reliably 24/7

---

## Detailed Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Components Setup

#### Gmail Trigger Configuration

**What We're Building:**
A reliable email monitoring system that checks for new messages every minute without overwhelming your Gmail API quota.

**Technical Details:**

- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure token-based access (no password storage)
- **Polling Frequency**: Every 60 seconds (optimal for free tier)
- **Smart Filtering**: Process only unread messages to avoid duplicates
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry on temporary failures

#### AI Classification Engine

**What We're Building:**
An intelligent classification system that understands context, not just keywords.

**Classification Dimensions:**

1. **Priority Classification** (Low/Medium/High/Urgent)
   - Urgent: Contains deadlines < 24 hours, critical keywords, VIP senders
   - High: Important but not time-critical, key stakeholders
   - Medium: Regular business matters, standard requests
   - Low: FYI, newsletters, non-actionable content

2. **Sentiment Analysis** (Positive/Neutral/Negative/Angry)
   - Positive: Praise, satisfaction, enthusiasm
   - Neutral: Factual, informational, procedural
   - Negative: Complaints, concerns, dissatisfaction
   - Angry: Strong language, threats, escalation needed

3. **Department Routing** (Sales/Support/Technical/HR/Finance/Other)
   - Sales: Pricing enquiries, demos, purchasing intent
   - Support: Help requests, bug reports, how-to questions
   - Technical: API issues, integration questions, feature requests
   - HR: Employment queries, policy questions, complaints
   - Finance: Invoicing, payments, billing issues

**The AI Prompt Strategy:**

```json
{
  "prompt": "You are an expert email classifier. Analyse this email and return ONLY valid JSON.",
  "criteria": {
    "priority": "Consider deadlines, sender importance, and action requirements",
    "sentiment": "Detect emotional tone beyond just positive/negative",
    "department": "Match content to most appropriate team",
    "confidence": "Rate your certainty (0.0-1.0)"
  },
  "instruction": "Be consistent and objective. When uncertain, choose the safest option."
}
```

#### Intelligent Routing Logic

**What We're Building:**
A decision tree that takes different actions based on email characteristics.

**Routing Rules Matrix:**

| Classification | Primary Action | Secondary Action | SLA |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|-----|
| Urgent + Angry | Immediate escalation | Manager notification | 15 min |
| Urgent + Any | Priority queue | Slack alert | 1 hour |
| High + Support | Create ticket | Assign to team | 4 hours |
| High + Sales | Add to CRM | Sales team notify | Same day |
| Angry + Any | De-escalation template | Senior staff alert | 30 min |
| Low + Any | Batch processing | Weekly digest | 1 week |

**Why This Routing Strategy:**

- Prevents important emails from being buried
- Ensures angry customers get immediate attention
- Optimises team workload distribution
- Creates audit trail for compliance

#### Automated Response System

**What We're Building:**
Multi-channel response system that acknowledges, tracks, and escalates appropriately.

**Response Actions by Priority:**

1. **Gmail Label System**
   - Visual inbox organisation
   - Quick filtering for manual review
   - Colour coding for at-a-glance priority

2. **Auto-Acknowledgements** (Support & Urgent only)
   - Confirms receipt within 60 seconds
   - Sets expectations for response time
   - Provides ticket number for tracking

3. **Calendar Integration** (Urgent items)
   - Creates follow-up reminders
   - Blocks time for important responses
   - Syncs with team calendars

4. **Performance Analytics**
   - Every classification logged with timestamp
   - Confidence scores tracked for model improvement
   - Response time metrics calculated automatically
   - Weekly reports on classification accuracy

> **Canvas navigation**: Click and drag to move around, scroll to zoom, right-click for options
>
#### Step 6: Gmail Trigger Setup

1. Click the plus button in the top right corner
2. Search for "Gmail" in the node panel
3. Select "On message received" trigger

   ![Add Gmail Trigger](./images/workflow/02-add-gmail-trigger.png)

4. Configure trigger:
   - Credential: select the credential we created earlier
   - Poll Time: Every Minute
   - Event: "Message Received"
   - Simplify Output: Toggle OFF

   ![Gmail Trigger Configuration](./images/workflow/03-gmail-trigger-config.png)

5. Test the trigger:
   - Click "Fetch Test Event"
   - Click "Listen for Event"
   - Send a test email to yourself

#### Step 7: Email Data Preparation

1. Add "Code" node after Gmail Trigger
2. Name it: "Prepare Email for AI"
3. Mode: "Run Once for Each Item"
4. Language: "Javascript"

   ![Add AI Node](./images/workflow/04-add-ai-node.png)
Add this code:

// Extract and clean email data
const emailData = {
  sender: $input.item.json.from.value[0].address,
  senderName: $input.item.json.from.value[0].name || 'Unknown',
  subject: $input.item.json.subject,
  body: $input.item.json.text || $input.item.json.snippet,
  receivedDate: $input.item.json.date,
  messageId: $input.item.json.id,
  threadId: $input.item.json.threadId
};

// Clean body text (remove signatures, quotes)
emailData.cleanBody = emailData.body
  .split[/\r?\n-- \r?\n/](0)  // Remove signature
  .split[/On .+ wrote:/](0)    // Remove quoted text
  .trim();

// Truncate for API limits (first 1000 chars)
emailData.truncatedBody = emailData.cleanBody.substring(0, 1000);

return {
  json: emailData
};

#### Step 8: AI Classification Node

1. Add "Basic LLM Chain" node (under AI nodes)
2. Source for Prompt: "Define below"
3. Require Specific Output Format: toggle ON

Close the node. We will now add the Chat Model, and the Output Parser.

Click the ‚Äú+‚Äù under Chat Model
Pick OpenRouter Chat Model

In the OpenRouter node, choose the credentials we created earlier.
Scroll down to select "google/gemma-3-27b-it:free"

   ![OpenRouter Configuration](./images/workflow/05-openrouter-config.png)

Click the ‚Äú+‚Äù under Output Parser

Click Structured Output Parser
Put the following content as the JSON Example

{
  "priority": "",
  "sentiment": "",
  "department": "",
  "actionRequired": false,
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation"
}

Go back to the Basic LLM Chain node. Now, add the Prompt:

   ![AI Prompt Setup](./images/workflow/06-ai-prompt-setup.png)

Analyze this email and classify it. Return ONLY valid JSON.

Email from: {{$json.senderName}} <{{$json.sender}}>
Subject: {{$json.subject}}
Body: {{$json.truncatedBody}}

Classify as:

1. Priority: "urgent" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
2. Sentiment: "positive" | "neutral" | "negative" | "angry"
3. Department: "sales" | "support" | "technical" | "hr" | "finance" | "other"
4. Action Required: true | false
5. Confidence Score: 0.0-1.0

#### Step 9: Parse AI Response

Add "Edit Fields" node after Basic LLM Chain
 Name it: "Parse Classification"

   ![JSON Parser Node](./images/workflow/07-json-parser-node.png)
 Operation: "Set Fields"
 Mode: "Manual Mapping"
Configure the following field assignments:
From the AI Classification (Basic LLM Chain output):
priority ‚Üí ={{ $json.priority }}
sentiment ‚Üí ={{ $json.sentiment }}
department ‚Üí ={{ $json.department }}
actionRequired ‚Üí ={{ $json.actionRequired }} (Type: Boolean)
confidence ‚Üí ={{ $json.confidence }} (Type: Number)
reasoning ‚Üí ={{ $json.reasoning }}
From the Email Data (Prepare Email for AI node):
emailId ‚Üí ={{ $('Prepare Email for AI').item.json.messageId }}
subject ‚Üí ={{ $('Prepare Email for AI').item.json.subject }}
sender ‚Üí ={{ $('Prepare Email for AI').item.json.sender }}
senderName ‚Üí ={{ $('Prepare Email for AI').item.json.senderName }}
Additional fields for error handling:
error ‚Üí ={{ $json.error ? true : false }} (Type: Boolean)
This Edit Fields node will:
Extract the classification results from the Basic LLM Chain's structured output
Combine them with the original email data from the "Prepare Email for AI" node
Create a clean, unified data structure for the Switch node to use
The key difference from your example is that:
The Basic LLM Chain with Structured Output Parser outputs directly to $json (not $json.output)
We're adding the department field which was missing
We're using the correct node reference syntax $('Prepare Email for AI').item.json.fieldName

#### Step 10: Routing with Switch Node

Add "Switch" node
 Name it: "Route by Priority & Sentiment"
 Mode: "Rules"
 Options: Set "Fallback Output" to "extra"
Configure routing rules:
Output 1 - Urgent:
Conditions:
Priority equals "urgent"
Rename Output: Toggle ON
Output Name: "Urgent"
Output 2 - High Priority:
Conditions:
Priority equals "high"
Rename Output: Toggle ON
Output Name: "High Priority"
Output 3 - Angry Email:
Conditions:
Sentiment equals "angry"
Rename Output: Toggle ON
Output Name: "Angry Customers"
Output 4 - Low Priority:
Conditions:
Priority equals "low"
Rename Output: Toggle ON
Output Name: "Low Priority"
The fallback output (automatically created as "extra") will catch all medium priority and neutral sentiment emails.
How to add conditions in the Switch node:
Click "+ Add Rule" for each output
For each rule:
Set the Left Value to the field (e.g., {{ $json.priority }})
Choose the operator (equals)
Set the Right Value (e.g., "urgent")
Toggle "Rename Output" and give each output a descriptive name
The "extra" output will automatically handle any emails that don't match the rules
This simplified routing ensures:
Urgent emails get immediate attention
High-priority emails are fast-tracked
Angry customers get special handling
Low priority emails can be batched
Everything else (medium priority, neutral sentiment) follows standard processing

#### Step 11: Gmail Label Application

   ![Gmail Label Action](./images/workflow/08-gmail-label-action.png)

**Creating Labels in Gmail (Prerequisites)**
Open Gmail in your browser
Click the gear icon ‚Üí "See all settings"
Go to "Labels" tab
Create these labels:
URGENT-SUPPORT
HIGH-PRIORITY
ANGRY-CUSTOMER
LOW-PRIORITY
STANDARD-PROCESSING
Configuring Gmail Nodes
For Urgent Output:
Operation: "Label Add"
Message ID: {{ $json.emailId }}
Labels: Select "URGENT-SUPPORT"
Now repeat the same for other labels
Real-World Impact
For Support Teams:
Urgent labels integrate with helpdesk software
Automatic ticket creation for high-priority items
SLA tracking becomes automated
For Sales Teams:
Hot leads are never missed
Follow-up reminders can be triggered
Response time metrics improve dramatically
For Management:
Real-time visibility into email volumes by priority
Can identify training needs (too many angry customers?)
Data-driven decisions about staffing

#### Step 12: Logging to Google Sheets

1. Add "Google Sheets" node at the end
2. Connect Google account

   ![Google Sheets Node](./images/workflow/09-google-sheets-node.png)

3. Configure:

Operation: "Append"
Document: Create "Email Classification Log"
Sheet: "Sheet1"
Data:

json{
  "Timestamp": "={{new Date().toISOString()}}",
  "Sender": "={{$json.sender}}",
  "Subject": "={{$json.subject}}",
  "Priority": "={{$json.priority}}",
  "Sentiment": "={{$json.sentiment}}",
  "Department": "={{$json.department}}",
  "Action Required": "={{$json.actionRequired}}",
  "Confidence": "={{$json.confidence}}",
  "Reasoning": "={{$json.reasoning}}"
}
